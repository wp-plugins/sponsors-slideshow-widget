== HowTo ==
Include fancy slideshows on your website in an instance. The plugin offers different sources for generating slideshows including links, images or posts

= Links =
1. Create at least one category and add links including Image Address
2. Choose corresponding links category as source

= Images =
1. The plugin enables media galleries
2. Upload images and add the desired images to a gallery
3. Choose corresponding image gallery as source

= Posts/Pages =
1. Add featured images to posts or pages
2. Choose corresponding posts or pages category as source
3. In addition to the featured image, post title (slide title) and an excerpt (slide description) are displayed above linking to the post. This can be also customized through a post meta box

= Additional Slide Sources =
Probably a unique feature of the plugin is the possibility of adding additional external slide sources. It allows easy generation of slideshows from virtually any source and involves two wordpress filters.

The first step is to add slide sources to the selection menu

	add_filter( "fancy_slideshow_sources", "my_slideshow_sources" );

	function my_slideshow_sources( $sources ) {
		$sources['mysource'] = array(
			"title" => "Source Title",
			"options" => array(
				array( "value" => "mysource_ID", "label" => "Option 1" ),
				...
			)	
		);
		
		return $sources;
	}

This function has to add a multi-dimensional array to the already existing sources. The $sources['mysource']['options'] array will be converted to an optgroup with label $sources['mysource']['title']. The structure of the value field has to have the structure indicated, i.e. *mysource_ID*. It can be also extended at the end with further fields separated by _ which will be used to break the value into different fields.

The second step is to add a function that retrieves the data and sets up the slides data.

	add_filter( "fancy_slideshow_get_slides_<*mysource*>", "get_my_slides" );

You see that the filter has the *mysource* part included, which has to match the primary array key in the function my_slideshow_sources.

	function get_my_slides( $source ) {
		
		$source_ID = $source[1];
		
		// Do some stuff to get slides data
		...
		
		$slides = array();
		foreach ( $results AS $result ) {
			$slide = array(
				"name" => $result->name,
				"image" => $result->image_url,
				"url" => $result->url,
				"url_target" => '',
				"link_class" => 'thickbox',
				"link_rel" => '',
				"title" => $result->name,
				"slide_title" => $result->name,
				"slide_desc" => ""
			);
				
			$slides[] = (object)$slide;
		}
			
		return $slides;
	}

The above function gives a representative example of how the return array for each slide has to look like.

= Full width display =
In order to force full-width display of slideshows simply set width to 0px. The same applies to automatic slideshow height.
